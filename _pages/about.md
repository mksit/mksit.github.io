I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of <a href="https://luomai.github.io/">Luo Mai</a>. Prior to that, I received a MSc in Computer Science from Keio University in 2018 and a BEng in Computer Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research interests revolve around the intersection of Large Scale Machine Learning, Distributed Systems and Specialized Accelerators. The current research endeavors are centered on the design and development of automatic and scalable distributed systems to train gigantic machine learning models efficiently.
